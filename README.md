# RAMP
RAMP is a bicycle performance tracking system.

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v3.0.0-blue)

## Introduction
This project is designed to track the movement of a (downhill) bike througout the 3D sapce. From this data we can track and monitor performance and other telemetry data (f.e.: time spent in air, highest jump, highest speed etc.).
